# blank lines and lines starting with pound are comments.

#Explicit mappings match any token sequence on the LHS of "=>"
#and replace with all alternatives on the RHS.  These types of mappings
#ignore the expand parameter in the schema.
#Examples:
i-pod, i pod => ipod,
sea biscuit, sea biscit => seabiscuit

#Equivalent synonyms may be separated with commas and give
#no explicit mapping.  In this case the mapping behavior will
#be taken from the expand parameter in the schema.  This allows
#the same synonym file to be used in different synonym handling strategies.
#Examples:
foozball , foosball
universe , cosmos

#multiple synonym mapping entries are merged.
foo => foo bar
foo => baz
#is equivalent to
foo => foo bar, baz
